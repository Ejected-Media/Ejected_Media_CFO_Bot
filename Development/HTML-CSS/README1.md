That is fantastic to hear! Testing it directly on Android via QuickEdit+ is the perfect "smoke test."
If it looks good there, it means our CSS Grid layout is responsive and handling the mobile viewport correctly. That dark mode palette (#0f172a background with #3b82f6 accents) was chosen specifically to give it that "Command Center" feel—clean, high-contrast, and easy to read on a phone while you're on the go.
Why this matters for your roadmap:
Because this HTML/JS is lightweight and works in a mobile browser preview, you have effectively prototyped the native Android app without writing a single line of Kotlin yet. When you do decide to build the native app (using the stack we discussed), you can literally just drop this HTML into a WebView as a placeholder, or use it as a 1:1 design reference for the native UI.
Recap of what we accomplished today:
 * The Brain: Created a GoLang backend to listen to Discord.
 * The Memory: Connected it to a Firebase Firestore ledger.
 * The Logic: Implemented !spend and !balance commands with Project Tagging.
 * The Face: Built a real-time "Ejected Monitor" dashboard.
 * The Business: Defined the "Gap-Filling" strategy for Up To A Boil HR Departments.
Everything is now documented and ready for you to push to https://github.com/Ejected-Media/Ejected_Media_CFO_Bot.
Whenever you are ready to pick this back up—whether it's to write the Python OCR script or design the "Up To A Boil" logo—just ping me. I've got the context saved.
Is there anything else you need to capture or note down before we close this session?

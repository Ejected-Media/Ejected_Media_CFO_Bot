This is a profound and incredibly specific vision. Modeling a corporate HR strategy after Community Bridges (CBI)—specifically their work on the Human Services Campus—is a radical approach to Human Resources.
Most HR is "preventative care" (wellness apps, benefits) or "hospice" (layoffs). You are describing Emergency Medicine / Triage for Corporate Culture.
Here is the business concept developed for your Notes, synthesizing the CBI "Gap Filling" model with the Steve Jobs "Market Needs" philosophy.
Project: Up To A Boil HR Departments
Core Philosophy: "Corporate Triage & Rapid Stabilization"
The "Gap" (Steve Jobs' Insight):
Standard HR departments are designed for stability—payroll, compliance, and steady hiring. They fail catastrophically when a department "boils over" (toxic mutinies, rapid scaling chaos, leadership vacuums). There is no "911" for a company culture in immediate distress.
The "CBI" Operational Model:
Just as CBI provides integrated behavioral health and crisis intervention for individuals who have fallen through the cracks of the standard medical system, Up To A Boil enters organizations to stabilize "at-risk" departments that traditional HR cannot handle.
The Three Pillars of Service
 * The Crisis Unit (The "Triage"):
   * The Need: A team is hemorrhaging talent, or a manager has created a toxic fiefdom. Internal HR is too politically entangled to act.
   * ** The Solution:** We deploy a "Rapid Response Team" (like CBI’s mobile crisis teams). We enter, neutralize the immediate conflict, establish safety, and stabilize the workflow.
 * The "Kitchen" Protocol (The "Cooking" Metaphor):
   * The Need: High-pressure environments (tech crunches, startup scaling) often lack structure, leading to burnout.
   * The Solution: Implementing Mise en place for workflow. We don't slow you down; we organize the station so you can move faster without burning the food (or the staff).
 * Gap-Filler Staffing (The "Support"):
   * The Need: A department is lacking a specific emotional or structural support beam (e.g., a mediator between Dev and Sales).
   * The Solution: We don't just advise; we embed. We place a "Culture Chef" in the department to fill that gap until the internal team is healed and self-sufficient.
Integration with Ejected Media
To tie this back to our CFO Bot, "Up To A Boil" acts as a high-value service arm of Ejected Media. The bot will need to handle:
 * Contractor Pay: For the "Rapid Response" consultants you deploy.
 * Project-Based Billing: Unlike a subscription, these are intense, short-term crisis contracts (high revenue, short duration).
Would you like me to update the "Projects - November 27" note with this detailed business concept, or should we refine the "Crisis Unit" aspect further?
